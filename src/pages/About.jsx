                        <p>Hello! I'm Matthew Chin.</p>
                        <p>
                                I'm a Junior at UMD studying Computer Science and Business, currently studying abroad in Madrid. I'm currently building my skills in web development and general software engineering.
                                I'm currently based in the DC Metro Area, but I've grown up mostly in Northern New Jersey and the Boston Area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                I'm currently helping out a fashion-tech startup called Colexia as a Software Engineering Intern, and when I'm on campus, I help out as a Undergraduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.digitalengagementlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: "#0066cc", textDecoration: "underline" }}>Digital Media Engagement Lab</a> at the University of Maryland.
                                Below are some of my hobbies outside of school and work, and things that I would love to talk about!
                        </p>
